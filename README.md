# odin-recipes
This project is a page with multiple recipes. 
I will be using HTML to create multiple pages containing different Lord of the Rings recipes. 
Each page will consist of the different elements of HTML that I have learnt, namely text formatting(paragraphs, italics, bold, headings), as well as links to other pages and images.
This is my first real assignment. Success TBD.
