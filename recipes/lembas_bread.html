            <li>1/2 cup of honey (collected from the Beorning bees)</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Begin in a serene glade deep within Lothl√≥rien, where the air is filled with the scent of blossoms.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, blend the Elven flour and honey until it forms a dough as smooth as Galadriel's speech.</li>
            <li>Knead in the Elven butter, taking care to infuse it with the grace of the Eldar.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the dried waybread crumbs, which contain the wisdom of countless ages.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into squares, each just large enough to sustain a weary traveler.</li>
            <li>Use an Elven leaf pattern to mark each square for that touch of Rivendell elegance.</li>
            <li>Bake in the soft glow of the Evening Star at 350 degrees until the edges are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Cool the Lembas Bread on a bed of Elanor petals and let it rest beneath the light of the Evenstar.</li>
            <li>Wrap each square in a leathery Elven leaf for the journey ahead.</li>
          </ol>
