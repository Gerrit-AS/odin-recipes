        <h2>Description</h2>
        
          <p>Give them to me raw and wriggling</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>A small lake or river.</li>
            <li>Quick hands.</li>
          </ul>
          
        <h4>Instructions:</h4>

          <ol>
            <li>Sneaky Sneak</li>
                <p>Sneak, sneaky, precious! First, you must find yourself a nice, quiet pond or stream. Make sure to be as quiet as a mouse and as invisible as the One Ring. Gollum is the best at sneaking, yesss!</p>
            
            <li>Slippery Slap</li>
                <p>Find a slipper-sloppery fishy, my precious! The trick is to be quick, like a striking cobra. Plunge your skinny fingers into the water and grab the fishy right behind its gills. Be quick, or it will slip away, yes!</p>
           
            <li>Raw and Wriggling</li>
                <p>Hold the wiggly fishy up to your hungry lips, my precious. Feel its wiggles and squiggles in your hand. Gollum loves the wriggles, yesss!</p>

            <li>Crunchy Munch</li>
                <p>Now, don't be afraid, my precious. Take a bite, a big, juicy bite. Let the raw fishy flesh squish between your teeth. Crunch it good, just like Gollum does. Taste the river's secrets, the slimy, silvery secrets!</p>
            
            <li>Swiggle Down</li>
                <p>Gulp it down, my precious! Swiggle-swoggle it all the way to your belly. Feel the fishy's spirit become one with you, precious. Gollum's belly is happy now, yesss!</p>
            
            
          </ol>

        <p>Remember, my precious, this is how Gollum catches and eats a fish raw and wriggling. But be careful, and don't go biting on any fishy that might be too fishy for your liking!</p>
